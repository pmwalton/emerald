title: Historical Bonds
---
In order to find a new challenge, we decided to work with data Professor Hall deals with in his research on Historical Bonds. These were bonds distributed by American militias during the Revolutionary War.

These bonds were one of the main ways that the newly founded American army was financed. They would exchange these IOU's for goods with locals as they moved around the country fighting the British. After the US won the war, they set up centralized locations to reimburse the people who had helped finance the revolution.
